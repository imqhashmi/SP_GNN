# SP_GNN

This repository contains the implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach for synthetic population generation.
<!-- 
## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Dependencies can be installed via pip:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ``` -->

## Directory Description

- `code/`: Contains the main implementation files for the GNN-based synthetic population generation
  - `generatedHouseholds.py`: Implements the household generation algorithms
  - `generatedIndividuals.py`: Implements the individual population generation
  - `assignHouseholds.py`: Contains logic for household assignment and hyperparameter optimization
  - `outputs/`: Stores the generated outputs and results

- `data/`: Houses all data-related files and scripts
  - `raw-data/`: Contains the original, unprocessed input data
  - `preprocessed-data/`: Stores the processed and prepared data for model input
  - `encode_data.py`: Utilities for data encoding and preprocessing

## Getting Started

1 - Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed

2 - Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3 - Installing Pytorch

GPU:

To install pytorch with cuda support; find you cuda version and install pytorch for that version i.e. for cuda 11.8:
   ```
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```
CPU: 

If you want to use pytorch with CPU then run below command:
   ```
   pip install torch==2.7.0
   ```
4 - Prepare your data in the `data/raw-data/` directory

5 - Use the scripts in the `code/` directory to run the synthetic population generation
